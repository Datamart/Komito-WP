== 3rd Party External Script ==

This plugin leverages the functionality of Komito Analytics and it utilizes an external JavaScript file (https://komito.net/komito.js).
By using this plugin, you acknowledge that a third party script will be embedded into the website.

We understand the importance of data privacy and transparency, however, privacy is not a concern: Komito Analytics does not store any data.
Why? Because it's an extension for the most popular web analytics software, not a data collection service.
